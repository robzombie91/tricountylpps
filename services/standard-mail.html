<p>Tri-County Letter/Parcel Presort Service specializes in providing automation and presort fulfillment services for standard mailings. Here are some of the fundamental size and dimensions for a standard "bulk" mailing.</p>
<p>Standard Mail and Bulk Mail are primarily used by businesses and organizations to deliver information, offers, directions, reminders, or time response dates to various addresses. It's important to note, these letters are prohibited from containing personal information, financial numbers, or bill amount due requests.</p>
<p>There are times when standard mail may have a slower delivery, particularly for long-distance addresses. However, for close range addresses, delivery is usually as prompt as first class mail. USPS policies on mail forwarding and returning are somewhat restricted. Standard mail is typically not forwarded or returned unless specifically requested with a mailing endorsement.</p>
<p>Tri-County Letter/Parcel Presort Service, Inc. provides Move Update services to minimize potential problems and errors with mailing lists. These services ensure your company's and organization's mailings reach the intended customers.</p>
<p>The cost of postage for a mail piece, whether a postcard, a letter, a folded self mailer, or a letter envelope, is determined by its weight and zip-code presort levels. An additional benefit with standard mail is that the weight costs for the first 3 ounces are consistent, unlike first class mail. <b>Generally, standard mail will cost about half the postage of first class mail.</b></p>
<p>If necessary, we also provide Bound Printed Matter mailing services.</p>
